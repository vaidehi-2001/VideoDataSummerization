Hi friends welcome back to my channel again. So in this video we are going to
review oracle company. Let's jump into our video.
Friends before we start the video I would like to ask you to watch my
previous video. I have shared DevOps support engineer role for freshers in
oracle and one more thing is that you can bookmark my website google.com
using the star icon so you can access jobs easily and we have discussed in
our previous video regarding this job DevOps support engineer in Bangalore and
we have discussed about the salary part as well for the role it was 12 LPA and
now here we are reviewing the company using Glassware. So overall the company
has 3.9 rating which is good I mean you know for a company like oracle it
should be at least more than 4.2 but it is only 3.9 like it's an okay okay
company for every company if the rating is more than 3.5 I recommend people to
join in the company. So let's talk about more reviews internally and culture and
values this company has food rating diversity and inclusion 4.1 work life
balance 4.2 and senior management 3.6 compensation and benefits 3.3 and
career opportunities 3.7. So basically everything is good but
compensation and benefits is less than okay okay and the senior management and
career opportunities also some somewhat the company needs to concentrate on. So
senior management review indicates your manager might not be supportive or you
know you might get some issues with your manager and career coming to the
career opportunities it would be like you know you are not getting promoted or
something like that and compensation and benefits no hikes or less salary or less
from no promotions and keeping that aside 81% of the employees are
recommending their friends to join in the company 89% of the employees are
approving the CEO 78% the company has a positive business outlook but I am
expecting much more than this but however it's up to them and let's talk
about pros and cons working in this company so basically it is a it the pro
is great work environment for all employees flexible working hours and
environment work life balance is good for entry level position great benefits
for everyone here flexible working hours and good salary and the coming to the
cons no hike after you join or less or very less hike once in two year hike is
for two years no salaried hike from last three years oh my god it's hard to get a
promotion or salary increase there was no career growth in the team I was
working and no bonus for staff and G&A employees so basically friends since
the compensation rating is 3.3 you can assume how would be the cons and let's
talk about most recent reviews so we'll get to know how good the company is so
IT systems administrator in Bangalore actually is very good place to work
nothing to say it all I have about good all I have and awesome place to learn
and grow great learning opportunities really good product and modern tech stack
manager and fellow developers are friendly and helpful great work life
balance joining benefits are much less comparing to the major tech companies
so it's been two months since I joined full-time but I had that hikes or less
best company for work life balance but salary is not good great management many
opportunities to explore good work culture slow growth in salary work
culture flexibility professional peers learning scope management no hike work
and personal life balance oh my god so coming to the salary part this is pretty
bad I would say so I clicked on the jobs so there are seven four thousand three
hundred and sixty one job openings in this company but I recommend you to
apply from the career website here I have shared so you know so that you
won't fall in and you know in traps like a fake jobs just open this and it will
navigate you to the company website when you click on apply now so in this way you
can apply for the job job friends this is a 2022 hiring okay keeping that aside
let's talk about the salary part in this company how are the salaries here so for
applications in a salary is 12 lakhs often in a 11 lakh and you'll get
additional pay of five lakh twenty five thousand I don't know why but you are
getting associative consultant six lakh forty six lakh forty two thousand and
fifty two thousand is your variable pay applications developer five lakh is
additional pay you are getting ten lakh forty nine thousand as salary senior
consultant twelve lakh is salary and one lakh additional pay I don't think
much difference in the salary because you are getting additional pay of more
principal member of technical staff twenty five lakh salary and one lakh
twenty thousand additional pay project lead principal applications in their
twenty lakh salary and seventy eight thousand as a base I mean bonus so I
don't find much difference in the salary but however we use our reviews so the
highest paying job at our actually senior principal engineer with twenty
seven lakh thirty six thousand so these are some salaries friends you can
explore more by checking all this 2400 salaries when you have a time and let's
talk about the interviews so this interview page is really helpful because
you'll get some sort of idea on how difficult where you can get interview
and how would be the entire experience so difficult is 3.0 3.0 means you know
it's a bit difficult I would say but one more thing is that because the salary
hikes are not too frequent the difficulty should be less as per my
assumptions but somehow it is 3.0 let's talk about interviews at Oracle so
whenever you get an interview you will be interviewed at Oracle you might get
66 positive 66 percent positive experience 15 percent negative and 18
percent neutral experience so this is how you can have the interview experience
and let's talk about getting into an interview so if you are applying online
there is 30 percent chance you might get an interview call for campus
equipment 28 percent and 18 percent of the employees are recruiter height
employee referral 16 percent three other three in person to recruitment agency so
basically 30 percent of the employees are who have applied online only using
the carrier website glass door or anything and 28 percent these people are
fresher either freshers or hide from the campus recruitment and 18 percent people
will you know hrs will reach on the LinkedIn or call you and keeping that
aside you can explore more here so you will be getting some interview questions
and interview experience and how would be the interview process everything
friends so take a look and you can read 7221 interview feedbacks that's a good
number so let's talk about the benefits here so coming to the benefits it is
3.3 again it is really disappointed so I thought it should be more than 3.5 but
it is 3.3 however if you saw reviews and vacation days are similar in numbers
good thing is that managers are cooperating in giving days off without
much as well maternity in line with local government norms or actually
encourage work from home so our club balance was good one of the best place
to work it has decent perks and good working environment work life balance is
great at Oracle good medical cover holidays flexible from remote option very
good benefit structure really like the environment you can explore 1600
reviews for related to the you know benefits and you can click on photos
you will get to know how the culture is how the infrastructure is and where the
employees are based and everything that's the end of the video friends I
hope you really liked it my coming video I will be sharing more job related
information until then keep watching my videos and like share and leave a
