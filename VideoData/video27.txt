So hello friends, welcome to my channel job on a mess and in today's video I am going to discuss about
permanent work from home opportunity floated by Amazon which is
CM2A associate and freshers as well as experience candidates can apply
since since it is a permanent work from home, I thought to post this opportunity and
I'll discuss the eligibility how to apply as well as the interview questions. So be there in the video till the end
So regarding the eligibility criteria any graduate can apply you can be a fresher also up to two years experience
candidates can apply but if you have more and you are okay with the salary then you can apply also
You should have good communication skills. You should be internet savvy
Detail oriented and you should have some problem solving and analyzing skills
Now the job description
You will be responsible to monitor and and ensure the accuracy of the pricing analytics
You have to audit track and maintain the quality metrics of assigned processes
You will interact with the business automation and technology teams to help drive operational and system
Improvements in case if you haven't understood the job description completely later
I'll discuss an interview question and I'm sure from that you will understand what you will be doing in a typical day
Now the interview rounds round one is English grammar test, which will be pretty easy
And then the aptitude test then the manager round where they can ask you role based or even
analytical questions or some you know
Numerical based questions also and finally there will be an HR round and if you clear all those you'll get selected
Now about the job details salary will be around 2.25 to 2.5 LP
It is a work from home, but you have to be based in these states
So this is because of the reason that sometimes
You know, you may have to go to their office or sometimes
Your laptop may not be working. So their technician has to come to the place where you are living
So you cannot be just based anywhere in India you have to choose one of these states and stay there
Now the interview questions that can be asked in operations and manager round
What do you expect your typical workday to be like?
So you have to read job description and you have to show that you are really interested in this role
So I have prepared a simple answer so you that so that you can understand your responsibilities
I expect to be busy and have my hands full most of the day
I will have to keep track of the pricing of retail products and
Increase or decrease the price as per the market demand
I will also have to keep an eye on the processes of business operations and technology teams and
Suggest ways to improve their process. So this is your actual job description
now
An example a numerical question they can ask the average of 20 numbers is 0
Of them at the most how many can be greater than 0?
So if the average of 20 numbers is 0
And we can assume that numbers are x1 x2 till x20
So their sum will also be equal to 0
So the sum of numbers is 0 then at most 19 numbers can be positive and the 20th can be negative
Which will be equivalent to the sum of the first 19 so the sum can be 0 but most 19 can be positive
Then
They can ask you tell me about Amazon so that you must know about it when it was founded or who is the current CEO
So all this you can read
Then the HR round final they can ask you about your self-introduction
family background education background your interest and hobbies
Then why this rule so you can talk about the strengths that you have related to this rule like you like number crunching
You are detail-oriented
Multitasker you have good communications and give examples from the past where we have used these skills
Then are you willing to work on weekends and night shifts because they may that may be required
But you will have to work for five days only and two consecutive days will be off that is written in the game
Then why Amazon so you can talk about good things about Amazon like work culture employee well-being strong brand name learning opportunities
Why should we hire you so that for that I have already prepared a video I'll give the link in the description
Then when you are faced with a problem, what do you do that question?
