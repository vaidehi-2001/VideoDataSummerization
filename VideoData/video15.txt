In the last episode, we covered the Amazon fulfillment centers
and how horrible it is to work in one of these modern-day sweatshops.
But what about the office side?
What about life in the corporate world at Amazon?
Are the generous compensation packages worth it?
What about life at AWS, Amazon Web Services,
a line of business that generates over $60 billion in revenue?
Amazon's cloud computing solutions have been taking the business world by storm
and the money keeps pouring in, partly because it's not so easy to switch
once you're inside the Amazon ecosystem and they have their tentacles all over your data.
Amazon is always hiring, so let's find out what it's actually like to work here.
Here's what Amazon employees had to say on Glassdoor.com
Toxic environment
Pros
Pay
Benefits
Trust me, you'll need therapy
Cons
They are not really work from home
Managers, not leaders
Zero communication
Managers retaliate and use you as a scapegoat because you're replaceable
Everyone warns you, but you think this team will be different
Trust me, it's not
Not a career company
Pros
It is good to get the experience of a high-pressure, very fast-paced company,
but that comes with a steep price
Cons
I work in a corporate position
It is an incredible amount of hours and pressure,
definitely not for those that value time with family or their free time.
It may be worth it for professionals young in their career,
but certainly not for those with tenure and those who have families.
I would not recommend Amazon to any friends or family, period.
Great place to purchase items, horrible place to work
Advice to management
You need to figure out a way not to burn people out
Young managers and leadership are robots
You'll never retain talent with current pace and mindset
Imagine working for the richest mammal to ever walk the planet
Pros
Co-workers could sometimes be pretty swell
Cons
If you have a conscious, pretty much everything
If you can block out the bleak shadow of late-stage capitalism,
you can make some scruples and earn up to a 4% annual raise
Advice to management
Middle management does not care about anything beyond what's immediately in front of them
If they say they do, it's just to get on to the next conversation or task
Not necessarily their individual fault,
but it's a feature of the Amazon ecosystem to overwork and push employees
while trying to distract that Papa Jeffrey is exploiting the labor force from top to bottom
Work here if you want to stagnate your career for several years in a cutthroat, self-centered environment
Never accept work as a Sydney data center technician
Life advice
Pros
Smart but also arrogant people
Cons
Clear career progression path advertised in job ads is a lie
Automation increasing so skilled technicians not want it anymore
AWS now mostly wants unskilled trainees so they can pay them low salaries
No pay increases in annual reviews for senior technicians
No job security and managers bully senior technicians to leave or find reasons to fire them
People leave almost every month now and the same job ad is always open
Toxic environment and employees burnt out because managers make employees compete with each other
I think we should just appreciate the fact that these people really do not care about work-life balance in Australia
That's a country where people have options
Not equal opportunity and big promotions in this team are always white Aussies
Night shifts
Warehouse job urinating in bottles is better than this
Advice to management
We all know what your agenda is and how you exploit us and find legal loopholes to fire hard workers
There is no need to pretend that you care
Relieved to be out of Amazon Web Services and sad as it could be a great company
Pros
Wages were competitive but you are locked in on what you start on
You will need to leave and come back to get a pay rise
Promotions are harder than getting hired
Cons
Work-life balance is horrendous
Stress levels very high as a technical program manager
Massive turnover in staff and non-stop reorgs means you are continuously reinventing the wheel
AWS networking refused to invest in proper PM tools
It felt like Groundhog Day all the time
The company is woke to the point of being ridiculous
Which I think is a common theme now in most big tech companies
Relieved to be moving on
It feels like a meat grinder
It could be a great company but it seems the policy is to burn staff out and bring in fresh replacements
Wasn't worth it
Pros
Fast-paced environment, willing to take risks
Cons
Poor training, tracking, accountability and support structures
When I started at Amazon I read the negative reviews and thought I could handle it
I had previously worked for fast-paced companies with rank and stack and accountability systems, I did well
However, at Amazon the teams and locations that are not even remotely alike are ranked and stacked
Low performers are put on performance improvement plans with made up numbers and documentation
There was literally no reporting at the employee level
Higher level employees were promoted frequently to different projects so they weren't there to face consequences of this poor direction
I worked 60 to 80 hours a week for years with no end in sight
I regularly received calls while sleeping or on weekends
Keeping talent is unnecessarily difficult
Leadership promotion opportunities at lower levels heavily favor outside hires to inside promotions and pay 20% more for outside versus internal promotions
To the point that people leave for a year or so and then plan to come back for better pay treatment
This sounds moronic
On a personal note, I had the worst experience I ever had from a leader across 20 years of professional experience
The leader over me was in line for promotion and spent daily public calls berating me and my team
Everyone who has worked there more than two years had a horror story about some previous member of leadership who yelled and cursed at people under them
Just like anywhere else, your experience depends a lot on your manager
Speaking of someone who was in leadership, there's a lot of pressure to write up people and work them out without the supporting due diligence and training and help
Plenty of people work there and love it
I got mental health issues and lasting physical problems
I regret working there and probably will regret it for the rest of my life
Bad manager
I'm seeing a trend here
Pros, everyone is crazy smart
It's cool to work with a group of people who run as fast as you can and do things so quickly
Cons, the culture is toxic
It's critical to the point that it is rude, abrasive, demoralizing and extremely offensive on a personal level
I was told that I could not advance to senior leadership because I, quote, couldn't possibly be able to manage the working hours while having three young kids at home
I had left just four weeks after that exact comment
Throne under the bus
Pros, decent compensation and good on my resume
Cons, I was hired onto a team with 100% outside hires, so there was no institutional knowledge to learn from
All of my work was on services my team did not own and the team that did own them had no real investment in what I was doing
So getting support was like pulling teeth
From there, it was apparent that I would be better off on a different team
After interviewing internally, I had several offers
I decided to do the right thing and let my manager know I was planning to transfer out
Five minutes after that meeting, I was informed, oops, you're actually flagged as underperforming and just haven't been informed of that in any way until now
Convenient
A few weeks later, I was given a pip with impossible goals, so I took my severance and moved on
It was very clear to me that once I had no use for my manager, I was let go to avoid having to deal with finding someone else within the group to let go
I am so much happier not being at Amazon anymore
Well, these reviews have confirmed my worst fears and suspicions
I think anyone who has worked in Silicon Valley has heard these stories firsthand, but it's nice to get some confirmation from Glassdoor
